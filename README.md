# java-poker-counting-probability
This repo contains some combinatorial and probability code for class demonstrations.

# Demonstrations
- Be mindful of languages that implement arbitrary integer precision.
- Be mindful of intermediate calculations potentially causing integer overflow.
- Be mindful that probabilities are defined for the "long-run".  To be mathematically specific, probabilities entail a notion of a limit going to infinity.
